            "A Patronus Charm is a special bit of magic that requires a wizard to envision one of their happiest memories while casting the spell. The feeling of happiness must be genuine or strong enough to produce a radiant, ethereal beast, the embodiment of that wizard's positive emotions that serves as their protector. When you cast this spell, you can choose to conjure an incorporeal or corporeal patronus. If you attempt to cast this spell while frightened or within 60 feet of a dementor, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the number of dementors within 60 feet of you. A roll of 19-20 on the die automatically succeeds. On a success, you cast the spell. On a failure, you can only conjure an incorporeal patronus, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the spell fails entirely. At the end of your turn, if you are frightened or there are one or more dementors within 60 feet of you while concentrating on this spell, you must repeat the ability check. On a failure, your patronus vanishes and the spell ends. A patronus sheds light in a radius around it. You and friendly creatures can't be frightened while in your patronus's light. A dementor that starts its turn within this light or enters the light for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the patronus until the start of its next turn. Incorporeal Patronus: Your patronus takes the form of a 5-foot burst of glowing mist in an unoccupied space adjacent to you, shedding bright light in its space and dim light in a 5-foot radius. Corporeal Patronus: Your patronus takes the form of a wispy silver animal in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the patronus up to 60 feet (Medium or smaller), 45 feet (Large), or 30 feet (Huge). At any time during the patronus's movement, you can direct it to charge into a dementor within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the patronus. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 radiant damage and the patronus pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier.",

Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and aquatic creatures make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.",
